OpenGL Graphics Project

An OpenGL (GLUT) graphics project featuring multiple animated scenes, including an airport runway, a moving train, and a city environment.
The application supports real-time scene switching, day/night mode, weather effects, and animation control through keyboard input.

This project was developed for academic purposes to demonstrate basic computer graphics concepts using OpenGL and GLUT.

Features:
Multiple animated scenes (Airport, Train, City)
Day and night mode switching
Weather effects: rain and snow
Pause and resume animation
Adjustable animation speed
Keyboard-based user interaction

Keyboard Controls:

Scene Selection
1 – Airport Scene
2 – Train Scene
3 – City Scene

Environment Controls
N – Night Mode
D – Day Mode

Weather Controls
R – Rain ON
W – Snow ON
S – Rain/Snow OFF

Animation Controls
P – Pause Animation
C – Continue Animation
+ – Increase Speed
- – Decrease Speed

Technologies Used
C++
OpenGL
GLUT

How to Run
1. Install OpenGL and GLUT on your system.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler that supports OpenGL.
3. Run the executable and use the keyboard controls to interact with the scenes.

Notes: This project uses OpenGL immediate mode for simplicity and learning purposes. It is intended for educational use, not for production-level graphics development.
